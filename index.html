										<p>More About Me</p>
									</header>
									<p>After finding my passion while taking an environmental science class in highschool I achieved a Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science and a Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies. I genuinely enjoy learning about the environment and the different systems that are at play, and Geogrpahic Information Systems (GIS) is a great way to visualize the environment. GIS has been challenging, but I think its an interesting way to combine one's artistic ability and knowledge.</p>
									<p>I am passionate about the environment and want to share this with others. I use my creativity to responsibly visualize data and design maps that educate the community. I bring in new ideas and consider different perspectives to inform the community of how they can connect and work with nature.  </p>

									<h3>My Map Work</h3>
									<p>Not all maps are the same. Each one starts out as an idea mixed with some creativity. Below I have broken down my work into a few categories that describes their purpose. Take a look at some of my maps by clicking on the names or the pictures.</p>

									<h3>My Accomplishments</h3>
									<p>I've given you some brief information on my education. Here I go into a little more detail.<br>There is more to life than school so I have listed another big accomplishment.</p>

												<h4>Master of Science in Geospatial Technologies</h4>
												<p>I feel very fortunate to have been accepted into this program at UWT and to be a part of the 2019-2020 cohort. I have learned so much during this time period about coding, data, and the importnace of visuals. My capstone project is focused on getting the community involved in rainwater catchment systems to help with urban flooding in Kent, WA. <a href="https://csawyer4.github.io/estimateRainwater/" target="_blank">Master's Capstone</a></p>

												<h4>Bachelor of Science in Environmental Science</h4>
												<p>In my undergraduate degree I focused on geosciences, or earth sciences. I truly enjoy learning about the earth and the way different systems work together. I took restoration ecology, environmental geology, meteorology, and more. I graduated magna cum laude with a GPA of 3.96.</p>

												<h4>Geographic Information Systems Certificate</h4>
												<p>Many people told me how important GIS is especially in the field of environmental science. After learning about TGIS 311 Maps & GIS, an introductory class to GIS, I decided to do the certificate. I did a GIS project on geothermal energy in Washington for my undergraduate capstone project. <a href="https://csawyer4.wixsite.com/sawyergis/analysis" target="_blank">Undergraduate Portfolio</a></p>

												<h4>I Live in a Tiny House</h4>
												<p>At the end of 2019 I bought a less than 250 square foot tiny house on wheels. I have wanted a tiny house for years and am so happy to finally be living my dream. I believe having a tiny house is more environmentally friendly than normal houses today as they consume less energy. Living in a tiny house has taught me the importance of getting outside and how to live with less. Living alone during the pandemic has helped me discover my true self. </p>
